Files under distorion_generator are used for synthesizing distorted images.
-

Usuage:

distorted_img = distortion_generator( img, dist_type, level, seed )

Where img is the original pristine image, dist_type refers to a specified distortion type ranging in 1~9.

1, Gaussian Blur \
2, White Noise  \
3, JPEG Compression \
4, JPEG2000 Compression \
5, Contrast Change \
6, Pink Noise \
7, Image Color Quantization with Dither \
8, Over-Exposure \
9, Under-Exposure 

level is a specified degradation level range in 1~5.

seed should be fixed to be 1.


Training codes live in dbcnn folder.
-

Running the run_exp.m script to train and test on a specifid dataset across 10 random splits.

Prerequisite: Matlab(We use 2017a), MatConvNet (We use 1.0-beta25)ï¼Œ vlfeat(We use 0.9.2)

Pretrained s-cnn model is included in dbcnn\data\models, you should download vgg-16 model from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/ and put it in dbcnn\data\models.

You need to copy the matconvet/matlab folder to that of your matconvnet to modify the vl_simplenn.m and PDist.m files.
